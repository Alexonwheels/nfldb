This project uses API endpoints courtesy of sportsdata.io to create database table pages that show win/loss records of NFL teams and current NFL rosters.

-Currently the team stats page is only giving results for the 2023 season. This may have to do with the free trial nature of the API.
-Working on adding a team info page
-First version of team info page added
